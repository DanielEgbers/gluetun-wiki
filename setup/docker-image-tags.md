# Docker image tags

![Visitors count](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=gluetun.faq.dockerimage)

If you use the default `qmcgaw/gluetun` image, you are technically using the Docker image with the `:latest` tag.
If it happens to be **broken**, this page is for you.

## Release tags

‚ÑπÔ∏è [**Live list of recent image tags**](https://hub.docker.com/r/qmcgaw/gluetun/tags?page=1&page_size=&ordering=last_updated&name=v3)

[Multiple releases](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/releases) are made through time when the image is considered stable.

Each time a Github release is made, an associated Docker image tag is made, for example a `v3.1.0` release produces the image `qmcgaw/gluetun:v3.1.0`.

You can thus use one of these image tags if `:latest` doesn't work for you. Also, don't forget to [create an issue](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun/issues/new/choose) for it üòâ

Finally you can also use image tag `:v3` to get the latest stable release (for example `v3.28.2`),
although I would appreciate if you can use the latest image instead to detect issues faster.
